\arguments{
\item{celesta_obj}{an initialized and filtered Celesta object (provided by
\code{FilterCells})}

\item{max_iteration}{the maximum number of iterations}

\item{cell_change_threshold}{user defined threshold on when the iterative
cell-type assignment stops. The default value is 0.01, which means that if
the percentage of additional assigned cells is smaller than 1\% of the
unassigned cells, then cell-type assignment will stop.}

\item{min_diff}{user defined threshold on how much the largest cell-type
probability needs to be higher than the second largest cell-type probability.
The default value is 0. It is recommended to not change this value.}

\item{min_probability}{user defined threshold on the maximum probability
(i.e. a cell-type probability needs to be higher than this threshold for a
cell to be assigned to that cell type). The default value is 0. It is
recommended to not set this value higher than 0.5.}

\item{high_marker_threshold_anchor}{the upper threshold for each cell type}

\item{low_marker_threshold_anchor}{the lower threshold for each cell type}

\item{high_marker_threshold_iteration}{user defined marker expression
probability threshold for high expression for non-anchor cells}

\item{low_marker_threshold_iteration}{user defined marker expression
probability threshold for low expression for non-anchor cells}
}
\value{
a fully initialized Celesta object
}
\description{
Iteratively assigns cells based on spatial and protein
expression information.
